# Krypto
Krypto is my favorite math card game and I'm building an app to replicate the game so you can play it anywhere you go!
Started May 19, 2017.

Things to add: <br />
Solve Screen <br />
Favorites/saving <br />
Multiplayer/scorekeeping <br />
Online Multiplayer <br />
Classroom Sessions <br />
<br />
Mistakes and Things to Remember: <br />
Making on pictures turned out to be a hassle <br />
Formatting for the pictures was incorrect, so I had to restart <br />
Timer resetting images <br />
Error handling with NSExpression <br />
<br />
Bugs Avoided: <br />
Timer <br />
Invalid NSExpression <br />

Notes: <br />
MMSpreadsheetView to make better looking score <br />
Fixing constraints for dragging<br />

Disclaimer: This was created over the summer of 2017 before I had learned about software design, so you'll see some relatively poorly designed code. My design and implementation have gotten much much better. I plan to refactor this sometime in the future.
